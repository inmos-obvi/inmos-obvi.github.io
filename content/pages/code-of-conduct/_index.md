#### Purpose of document
- A code of conduct (CoC) is a statement of understanding among ourselves about expectations of behavior and values, and as an external statement, reflects our commitments to the community.

- This CoC applies to all members of the InMOS project. We also expect external collaborators to comply with this code when interacting with InMOS, and we extend guidelines (such as inclusion for authorship) to external collaborators.

- Key aspects of this document: Inclusivity, professionalism and conduct, team meetings, unacceptable behavior, authorship, scientific integrity, and conflict of interest.

- Management committee (or MC, Tim, Qian, Laure Z, Ralph) will deal with any issues arising.

- This CoC serves as a living document and will be updated as needed.


#### Inclusivity

- Enjoyable, high-quality research can only be conducted when we feel safe, secure, and supported. All group members are thus dedicated to a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of our personal characteristics and differences. The team recognizes that biases can be unconscious and creep into different aspects of academic life and research, such as meetings, publications, citations, hiring, etc. We will strive to consciously combat those biases and bring awareness to others.

- **Obligations to the InMOS project team**: We're on the same team. Help each other, especially those junior to you even if not directly working for you.

- Be aware of, and address your positionality, power, privileges, and values.

- Early career researchers (ECRs, or junior scientists) face additional challenges, having to navigate their career path in addition to performing their work. This additional uncertainty in their career can lead to added stress and possible burnout. If anything is placing overwhelming stress or preventing ECRs from performing at their potential, they are encouraged to discuss with their group lead or with any other mentors they feel most comfortable with. Sharing these issues can reduce stress and help others be accommodating towards their needs, and the team may be able to assist.

- The InMOS team follows the principle that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. As such all members are encouraged to communicate openly and frequently about their research, activities and the obstacles they might encounter along the way.

#### Professionalism and conduct

- Be respectful in all interactions, communications, and actions.

- Take care of your **choice of medium for communicating sensitive matters** (e.g., confidentiality, privacy, and the ethical handling of information and resources at the personal, institutional and national level).

- English is the official language during meetings, team interactions and communications.

- Make a point in learning people’s names and how to pronounce them correctly.

- Meetings and interactions:

	+ Be inclusive of all present, listen, invite input, be constructive.

	+ Be mindful of dominant personalities, including yourself.

	+ Employ appropriate and inclusive language.

	+ Follow appropriate etiquette, such as raising your hand (or virtual equivalent) , waiting for the chair or facilitator/moderator to give you permission to speak, and help the chair when they are unaware of an issue.

	+ Meetings should be structured. For meetings with multiple participants, an agenda, a chair (lead PI who is responsible for leading all discussions by following the agenda and staying on schedule), and a facilitator/moderator (the project manager) are recommended. For business meetings, or meetings that need a strategic report for management, the project manager will be appointed as the note taker.

- Respect other’s working hours and limited availability or response time due to family, personal, and other situations.

- Avoid misunderstandings and exclusion. Open communication of intent and understanding are key to avoiding misunderstandings and inadvertent exclusion.

- Response time and deadlines: Timely communication and meeting deadlines are essential for our collective success and professional integrity. Team members are expected to adhere to all deadlines. This includes submitting the scientific report by the specified deadline (a contractual obligation), as well as any other requests by our funders (made directly or via Management Committee). Everyone is expected to address correspondence in a reasonable time. This includes correspondence from the MC, which often relates to contractual issues, and therefore cannot be delayed.

#### Team meetings

- The team has limited occasions to meet and interact with each other, so it is particularly important to make these opportunities as effective as possible for everyone.

- The facilitator/moderator should send the meeting invite associated with the agenda with enough notice for people to review it and add on items, if need be.

- Similarly, if items on the agenda need advanced review time, they should be sent with enough notice for everyone to get a chance to review them and comment on them before the meeting.

- The project manager is the facilitator/moderator and note taker during meetings with the whole team. During subgroup meetings, a chair and note taker should be designated, if need be.

- During the meeting:
	- **Be present**. Listen to others and avoid multitasking.
	- Questions are best asked verbally, not in a written form. Raise your hand (or software equivalent), and wait for the chair or facilitator/moderator to give you permission to speak.
	- **Avoid side conversations**. This applies to conversations in the chat window while videoconferencing.
	- Additional points/comments that one prefers not to raise verbally during the meeting and side conversations on a specific topic are best reserved for our Slack channel **after the meeting is over**.

#### Unethical and/or unacceptable behavior

- **Unacceptable behaviors include racism, hate speech, harassment, threats, unwelcome sexual attention or contact, personal attacks.**

- If you are the subject of, or witness to, inappropriate behavior please **inform a member of the management committee**, or ask another member whom you trust to inform the committee.

- Watch out for inadvertent slights or language that might unintentionally be hurtful to others.

#### Authorship

- We will follow the **[Vancouver Group recommendations](http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/)** (VGR) on authorship for all M²LInES publications and products (including software, datasets and presentations). The authorship guidelines apply to both M²LInES members and external collaborators.

- We will use the **[CRediT taxonomy](http://credit.niso.org/)** for describing the authorship contributions.

- Ideas for manuscripts are often the results of group discussions and/or casual conversations among different members. Authors should strive to keep lines of communication with the rest of the team open at all stages of a manuscript creation, but especially in this early stage, when the same idea might have bubbled simultaneously in different minds. The creation process of manuscripts should then **allow sufficient time for co-authors to contribute and review**. Participants should strive to contribute and respond in a timely manner.

- Consequently, **authorship should be established early in the creation process and established openly by expressing intent to the group**; there are often parallel efforts underway in such an interconnected project and we wish to not deprive anyone of the opportunity to publish their own efforts when it appears to be a duplication or “scooped”.

- Appropriate acknowledgement of M²LInES is expected in publications and products. Prior to publications or any external communications, authors need to have written approval from NYU on whether our Grantor would like to be acknowledged. NYU will then ask them. If they do, the Grantor will provide the manner and wording of such acknowledgment. Should a publisher for an academic publication require the identification of the Grantor, you may identify them to the extent required by such publisher, as long as you give NYU at least 15 days advance notice to ask them.

#### Scientific integrity

- Research should be evidence based and presented **accurately and honestly**, without misleading statements or withholding of pertinent information.

- Research should ultimately be confirmed and verified by peers, i.e. published in **peer-reviewed** journals.

- **Transparency and reproducibility** of the research and publication process are required, not only to aid the peer review process but also as a guiding principle.

- The M²LInES team is committed to disseminate its research as broadly as possible. Whenever possible, all **publications should be submitted open access**, whether via the journal as a whole, or via payment of an open access fee. When not possible, all coauthors should take steps to submit the manuscript in their respective institutions’ internal server for publications, and also a pre-review server such as arXiv. Please note that the Grantor has a nonexclusive license to copy, publish and distribute any publications, studies, research or other copyrightable works funded by this Grant.

- Data used in publications should be made **openly available**, not just upon request. This can be prohibitive for some datasets but reduced forms of the data, as presented in the publication, are a minimum requirement. This is becoming the minimum standard at many society journals.

- **Copyright on codes**: All codes produced within the context of M²LInES should be hosted by the M²LInES GitHub organization. Software produced in collaboration with M²LInES but not solely for M²LInES should be open source and accessible without fee or authentication barriers. It is reasonable to use private repositories during development. The particular license is up to the original authors but i) should ideally be consistent with your host institution, and ii) must be either FAIR or open source. We suggest the MIT license. For other products such as text, images, websites, etc., we suggest the Creative Commons CC-BY license.

- M²LInES scientific impact will rise higher if all its parts are lifted higher. As such, **members are encouraged to amplify each other’s contributions to the project** when opportunities arise (after checking for permissions).

#### Conflicts of interest

- Many members of M²LInES are involved in other projects or have collaborators conducting related research. If a research idea being actively pursued by M²LInES happens to overlap with a colleague or collaborator of M²LInES then there can be a conflict of interest, or a perception of such even if none exists.
**We expect members to recognize or anticipate these situations and to inform M²LInES of any overlap** to avoid problems arising, discussing them with the management committee.

- **Disclosure and regular communication within M²LInES** is by far the best way to avoid misunderstandings and conflicts among the group.
