This innovative effort leverages the availability of big data from high-resolution simulations, as well as data assimilation products (combining models and observations), with powerful machine learning algorithms to improve the representation of subgrid physics in the ocean, sea-ice and atmosphere components of existing climate models.)
-->
Our approach leverages the strong observational constraints on heat, O2, and carbon and their physical
linkages, builds on recent advances in multi-scale machine learning (ML) and ocean
modeling, incorporates previously neglected datasets (e.g. atmospheric data), and fills a
critical data gap with new observations.
