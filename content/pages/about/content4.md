This innovative effort leverages the availability of big data from high-resolution simulations, as well as data assimilation products (combining models and observations), with powerful machine learning algorithms to improve the representation of subgrid physics in the ocean, sea-ice and atmosphere components of existing climate models.)
-->

**Major innovations include:**
1. Bridging the gap between two classes of state-of-the art models: (i) Assimilation systems that are
optimized to describe the long-term ocean mean state. (ii) High resolution forward ocean models
that simulate changes on fine space and time scales but, for computational reasons, cannot be
optimized to represent larger-scale phenomena accurately.
1. Leveraging the coupling between fluxes of O2, carbon, and heat associated with air-sea exchange,
ocean transport, and biological processes.
1. on air-sea fluxes of O2, CO2 and heat provided by the measurements of atmospheric O2 and CO2 that
now span many decades.
1. Filling a major gap in the atmospheric O2 measurement network by supporting the installation of
atmospheric O2 analyzer systems in the Southern Ocean coordinated out of South Africa, thereby
also diversifying international participation.
1. Leveraging recent advances in the parameterization of sub-grid processes informed by ML to
improve model fidelity.
