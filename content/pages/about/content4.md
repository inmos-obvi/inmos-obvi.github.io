This innovative effort leverages the availability of big data from high-resolution simulations, as well as data assimilation products (combining models and observations), with powerful machine learning algorithms to improve the representation of subgrid physics in the ocean, sea-ice and atmosphere components of existing climate models.)

Major innovations of this project include:
1. Bridging the gap between two classes of state-of-the art models: (i) Assimilation systems that are optimized to describe the long-term ocean mean state. (ii) High resolution forward ocean models
that simulate changes on fine space and time scales but, for computational reasons, cannot be optimized to represent larger-scale phenomena accurately. We plan to bridge these models via a novel ML+DA framework: Multi-model Machine Learning ocean-atmosphere Emulation-Assimilation Framework (M3Leaf). This framework is trained to emulate the variability of high-resolution forward models and assimilate large-scale mean state and oceanic and atmospheric observations, thus yielding a multi-scale product that is compatible with observations at all scales.
2. Leveraging the coupling between fluxes of O<sub>2</sub>, carbon, and heat associated with air-sea exchange, ocean transport, and biological processes. These have been included previously in forward models but not assimilation systems, due to lack of a suitable framework.
3. Representing atmospheric variability within the framework, to take full advantage of the constraints
on air-sea fluxes of O<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub> and heat provided by the measurements of atmospheric O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> that now span many decades.
4. Filling a major gap in the atmospheric O<sub>2</sub> measurement network by supporting the installation of atmospheric O<sub>2</sub> analyzer systems in the Southern Ocean coordinated out of South Africa, thereby also diversifying international participation.
5. Leveraging recent advances in the parameterization of sub-grid processes informed by ML to improve model fidelity.
<!---
Our approach leverages the strong observational constraints on heat, O2, and carbon and their physical linkages, builds on recent advances in multi-scale machine learning (ML) and ocean modeling, incorporates previously neglected datasets (e.g. atmospheric data), and fills a critical data gap with new observations.
