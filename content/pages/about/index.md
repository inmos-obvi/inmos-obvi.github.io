heroSubHeading: "The core research aims of the InMOS project are: 
* Quantify the total oceanic CO2 sink and determine the anthropogenic and climate-driven
controls on oceanic CO2 uptake.
* Assess the trends, drivers, and distribution of ocean deoxygenation.
* Develop emergent theory and parametrizations linking deoxygenation, CO2 uptake, and
heat uptake through ocean circulation and biological processes.
* Produce novel observational products and modeling tools for integrated constraints on
ocean carbon and oxygen cycling."
