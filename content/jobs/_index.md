InMOS affirms the value of differing perspectives in Sciences. To ensure a diverse applicant pool and equitable review for all open positions, we will:
* solicit internationally through broad networks, including throughout the Global South,
* augment the recruitment via peer-to-peer contacts (recognizing that diverse recruitment requires more than advertising),
* establish a shared oversight committee for all hires including at least one outside expert in DEIA.
