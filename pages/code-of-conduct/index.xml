This CoC applies to all members of the InMOS project. We also expect external collaborators to comply with this code when interacting with InMOS, and we extend guidelines (such as inclusion for authorship) to external collaborators.
Key aspects of this document: Inclusivity, professionalism and conduct, team meetings, unacceptable behavior, authorship, scientific integrity, and conflict of interest.</description></item></channel></rss>
